## Why?

I recently decided I wanted to learn Next.js and, like most people, I learn best by rolling up my sleeves and getting my hands dirty. I chose Next.js for it's ability to serve static pages as well as server side render pages if I ever decide to connect to a Rails backend or Firebase or something similar. A few more reasons for choosing Next.js include: zero configuration (coming from a Rails background, this was a welcome feature), fast refresh, TypeScript support, file-system routing, code-splitting and many more.

At the same time, my goal was to develop a platform where I can catalog my thoughts and hopefully share useful information with other developers. I don't expect I'll write a new post every day or even every week but hopefully as I learn new libraries/technologies, I'll document my process here.
