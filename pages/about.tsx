              Hey, Iâ€™m Steve Torrence. I'm a software developer with a
              background in music education. I currently work at CrateBind, a
              consulting agency in Dallas that specializes in creating custom
              software, mobile apps and websites.

              Music played a significant role in my life growing up. I attended
              Sam Houston State University and pursued a degree in Music
              Education.

              After 7 incredible years teaching at the high school and middle
              school level, I felt it was time for a change. I decided it was
              time to pursue my other great passion: Technology! In 2018, I
              attended the Coding Dojo Bootcamp in Dallas. There I was
              introduced to the wonderful world of Javascript, Python, and Ruby!

              Soon after the bootcamp, I was hired as a developer at CrateBind.
              My first two years, I had the opportunity to learn and work with
              some incredibly smart people.

              I'm soon coming up on my third year as a developer and I'm finding
              there's still so much to discover. I'm hoping to use my blog as a
              means of organizing my thoughts and sharing any bits of wisdom I
              discover along the way!
