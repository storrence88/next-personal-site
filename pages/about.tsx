              Hey, Iâ€™m Steve Torrence. I'm a developer, musician, and educator
              and I currently work at Cratebind in Dallas as a backend
              developer.

              I grew up in Houston, Texas and was a HUGE band nerd in high
              school. Of course, I played the best instrument, the bass
              trombone. I followed my passion for music into college where I
              attended Sam Houston State University and pursued Music Education.

              Immediately after graduating, I packed up and moved to Dallas for
              my first teaching gig! After spending 7 years teaching at the
              highschool and middle school level, I decided it was time to
              pursue my other great passion: Technology!
            </Text>
            <Text color={secondaryTextColor[colorMode]} mb={4}>
              Immediately after leaving the education field, I attended the
              Coding Dojo Bootcamp. There I was introduced to wonderful world of
              Javascript, Python, and Ruby!
            </Text>
            <Text Text color={secondaryTextColor[colorMode]} mb={4}>
              After completion of the bootcamp, I was brought on as a backend
              developer at a consulting agency, Cratebind. During my first two
              years working there I had the opportunity to work with and learn
              from amazingly smart people while picking up many new strategies
              and technologies along the way.
