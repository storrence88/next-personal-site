              Hey, Iâ€™m Steve Torrence. I'm a software developer, musician, and
              educator. I currently work at CrateBind, a consulting agency in
              Dallas that specializes in creating custom software, mobile apps
              and websites for our clients.

              Originally from Houston, music played a significant role in my
              life growing up. I was a HUGE band nerd in high school. ðŸ¤“ Of
              course, I played the best instrument, the bass trombone! After
              graduating from high school, I wanted to give back and share my
              passion for music with others. I attended Sam Houston State
              University and pursued a degree in Music Education.

              Immediately after graduating, I packed up and moved to Dallas for
              my first teaching gig! I spent the next 7 incredible years
              teaching at the high school and middle school level. During that
              time, I had the opportunity to meet and study with many fantastic
              musicians and educators while teaching hundreds of students. I
              learned so during my time as a teacher but due to the changing
              climate of the education system, I felt it was time for a change.
              I decided it was time to pursue my other great passion:
              Technology!

            <Text color={secondaryTextColor[colorMode]} mb={4}>
              Immediately after leaving teaching, I attended the Coding Dojo
              Bootcamp in Dallas. There I was introduced to the wonderful world
              of Javascript, Python, and Ruby!

              Soon after the bootcamp, I was hired as a developer at CrateBind.
              My first two years, I had the opportunity to work with and learn
              from some really smart and amazing people!

            <Text Text color={secondaryTextColor[colorMode]} mb={4}>
              I'm soon coming up on my third year as a developer and I'm finding
              there's still so much to discover! I'm hoping to use my blog as a
              means of organizing my thoughts and sharing any bits of wisdom I
              discover along the way!
