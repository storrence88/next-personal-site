              Hey, Iâ€™m Steve Torrence. I'm a software developer with a
              background in music education. I currently work at CrateBind, a
              consulting agency in Dallas that specializes in creating custom
              software, mobile apps and websites.

              Music played a significant role in my life growing up. After
              graduating from high school, I attended Sam Houston State
              University and pursued a degree in Music Education.

              After 7 incredible years teaching at the high school and middle
              school level, I felt it was time for a change. I decided it was
              time to pursue my other great passion: Technology! In 2018, I
              attended the Coding Dojo Bootcamp in Dallas. It was there I was
              introduced to the wonderful world of Javascript, Python, and Ruby!

              Soon after the bootcamp, I was hired as a developer at CrateBind.
              I spent my first two years working closely with other developers
              absorbing as much information as possible!

              Fast forward to 2020 and I'm coming up on my third year as a
              developer. I'm finding there's still so much to discover and I'm
              hoping to use my blog as a means of organizing my thoughts and
              sharing any bits of wisdom I discover along the way!
